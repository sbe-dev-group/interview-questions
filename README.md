# interview-questions
This is a collection of exercises used for our interview process.

## Note
You will notice that there a several directories, some prefixed with UI and others PS. These prefixes represent two types of exercises. One User Interface and the other is Problem Solving. Each directory includes a README with the instructions for that exercise.

## Instructions
1. Clone git repo so you can upload your work to your own repo later.
2. Select one UI exercise and one PS exercise you would like to work.
3. Review instructions for each exercise in that directory's README.
4. Commit all your work into the applicable directory and push your work to any web-based git platform (GitHub, Bitbucket.. etc.)
5. Send in the link to our finished repo for review

## Rules
* For UI exercises, you may use any UI framework you choose, or none at all
* For PS exercises you should not use any libraries, just vanilla JS
* All completed exercise files should reside in the applicable exercise's directory
* Add comments to each exercise README describing how to run your code
